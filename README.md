# Neural Networks

A from-scratch implementation of neural network components in Python.

## Components

- **Dense Layers** - Fully connected layers with forward/backward propagation
- **Activations** - ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax
- **Loss Functions** - Binary/Categorical Cross-Entropy, MSE, MAE, Huber
- **Optimizers** - Batch Gradient Descent with momentum and decay

## Usage

Open `Neural_nets.ipynb` and run the cells to see implementations.

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
